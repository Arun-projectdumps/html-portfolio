<h1>Anime Rating According to Arun</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Animes of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>
  Man, this anime comes out on top just because of the pure foreshadowing
  details that were added to it.
</p>

<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>
  I mean, it was one of the most-watched animes and the visuals were damn great.
</p>

<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
<p>Gojo is dead (I guess) for now, so yeah — without Gojo, it’s at number 3.</p>

<h4>Honorable Mentions</h4>

  Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress<br />
  Solo Leveling<br />
  One Punch Man
